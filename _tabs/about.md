Welcome to my page where I share my knowledge that I gain through CTF's, Labs and Courses. 

To those that don't know me, i'm a father of 2 and I enjoy expanding my knowledge in the IT and Cyber Realm and this is my first take at broadcasting what i am busy with to the world.

The reason for doing this is 2 fold. It forces me to take better notes on CTF's, Labs and Courses which in turn helps with note keeping on Pentest engagements (Which will ofcourse not be posted :) ) and the second part is I might help someone else grasp a concept better, learn about new tools, techniques or find a learning platform they might not have heard of etc. So really, its a win-win. 

Hope you enjoy the content and any feedback is always welcome. 

Feel free to share any of the posts and enjoy the journey of unending knowledge. :)
